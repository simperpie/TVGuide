They loathe each other when they meet for the first time, but are soon forced to work together to face unexpected circumstances when they are accused of a crime they have not committed. The BSF, CBI and mafia are all on their tails. This deadly escapade interrupted by personal clashes eventually creates a bond between Aftab and Jay, who must fight against all odds to prove their innocence.</desc>
